<BODY>Nothing has ever broken me like you did No one I ever wanted more than you Nobody else can make a man so weak Make him fall in love so deep Baby  No one has ever known me like you did There’s just no other girl to see me through And every single memory I know Reminds me that I m all alone, all alone  If I could just get over you I would Don t wanna love you anymore And missing you is like fighting a war It s a battle I’m losing And I’d give up girl if I could If I could walk away as easily as you I Would  Thought I’ve seen enough to know it all But not enough to know how it feels to fall But the kind of pain you left me with It never seems to heal And it never lets me go  REPEAT  Tell me how do I live with tainted love? Tell me how can I feel no feelings? Is there a way to leave it all behind?  If I could just get over you I would Don t wanna love you anymore And missing you is like fighting a war It s a battle I’m losing And I’d give up girl if I could Just tell me how to walk away Away from loving you And I Would  ●─╂─Φ▶ ★ 쁘띠에의 발칙한 n6n6 ★ ◀Φ─╂─●  ●─╂─Φ▶ ★ ▩▣ 요조비은 ♡ BiOiOF7i ▣▩ ★ ◀Φ─╂─●  ●─╂─Φ▶ ★º♡º사랑해^&^행복해 ♣ º♡º ★ ◀Φ─╂─●  2013.06.06 언제나 사랑스러운.. ^^ </BODY>
