<BODY> California King Bed Rihanna 리아나  Chest to Chest Nose to nose Palm to palm We were always just that close Wrist to wrist Toe to toe Lips that just like the inside of a rose So how come when I reach out my finger It feels like then distance between us In this California king bed We re ten thousand miles apart I ll be California wishing on the stars For your heart, for me My California king Eye to eye Cheek to cheek Side by side You were sleeping next to me Arm in arm Dusk to dawn With the curtains drawn And a little last night on these sheets So how come when I reach out my fingers It feels like then distance between us In this California king bed We re ten thousand miles apart I ll be California wishing on the stars For your heart, for me My California king Just when I felt like giving up on us You turned around and gave me one last touch That made everything feel better And even then, my eyes got wetter Something feels, wanna ask you if you love me But I don t wanna seem so weak Maybe I ve been California dreaming Hey In this California king bed We re ten thousand miles apart I ll be California wishing on the stars For your heart, for me My California king My California king In this California king bed We re ten thousand miles apart I ll be California wishing on the stars For your heart, for me My California king </BODY>
