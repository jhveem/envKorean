<BODY>Cold as ice And more bitter than a December Winter night That’s how I treated you And I know that I I sometimes tend to lose my temper And I cross the line Yeah that’s the truth  I know it gets hard sometimes But I could never leave your side No matter what I say  ‘Cause if I wanted to go I would have gone by now But I really need you near me here Keep my mind off the edge If I wanted to leave I would have left by now But you’re the only one that knows me Better than I know myself  All along I tried to pretend it didn’t matter If I was alone But deep down I know If you were gone For even a day I wouldn’t know which way to turn ‘Cause I’m lost without you  I know it gets hard sometimes But I could never leave your side No matter what I say  ‘Cause if I wanted to go I would have gone by now But I really need you near me here Keep my mind off the edge If I wanted to leave I would have left by now But you’re the only one that knows me Better than I know myself  I get kind of dark Let it go too far I can be obnoxious at times But try and see my heart ‘Cause I need you now So don’t let me down You’re the only thing in this world I would die without  ‘Cause if I wanted to go I would have gone by now But I really need you near me here Keep my mind off the edge If I wanted to leave I would have left by now But you’re the only one that knows me Better than I know myself  ‘Cause if I wanted to go I would have gone by now But I really need you near me here Keep my mind off the edge If I wanted to leave I would have left by now But you’re the only one that knows me Better than I know myself 가사입력 네이버 출처NAKMUSE</BODY>
