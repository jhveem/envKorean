<BODY>Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don t know  Cause a bottle of vodka is still lodged in my head And some blond gave me nightmares I think she s still in my bed As I dream about movies they won t make of me when I m dead  With an ironclad fist I wake up and french kiss the morning While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we re talking About all of the things that I long to believe About love and the truth and what you mean to me And the truth is baby you re all that I need  I want to lay you down on the bed of roses For tonight I sleep on bed of nails I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down on bed of roses  Well I m so far away That each step that I take is my way home A king s ransom in dimes I d given each night Just to see through this payphone  Still I run out of time Or it s hard to get through till the bird on the wire flies me back to you I ll just close my eyes and whisper, “Baby blind love is true”  I want to lay you down on the bed of roses For tonight I sleep on bed of nails I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down on bed of roses  The hotel bar’s hangover whiskey s gone dry The barkeeper s wig s crooked And she s giving me the eye I might have said yeah But I laughed so hard I think I died  I want to lay you down on the bed of roses For tonight I sleep on bed of nails I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down on bed of roses  ㈕직도 남o†nㅓ＼、、＼、。 </BODY>
