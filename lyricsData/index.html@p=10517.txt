<BODY> to moonn6pence from shootingstar  Patrick Stumph vocals / guitars  Peter Wentz bass  Andrew Hurley drums  Joseph Trohman guitars   2001년 일리노이즈주 시카고 근교의 윌멧에서 결성된 4인조 팝펑크락 밴드. Fall Out Boy라는 밴드명은 결성 초기에 공연 도중에 팬들이 지어준 이름이라는데, 이들이 관중들을 향해 우리 이름 무어라고 하면 좋을까요? 했더니 관중들이 다함께 Fall Out Boy요 라고 하나같이 외치더라고 한다.  Simpsons라는 만화영화에 나오는 Radioactive Man의 조수로 나오는 캐릭터.  Am I more than you bargained for yet? I ve been dying to tell you anything you want to hear. Cause that s just who I am this week. Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum. I m just a notch in your bedpost, But you re just a line in a song. A notch in your bedpost, but you re just a line in a song.   Drop a heart, break a name. We re always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team.  We re going down, down in an earlier round. And Sugar, we re going down swinging. I ll be your number one with a bullet; A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it.  We re going down, down in an earlier round. And Sugar, we re going down swinging. I ll be your number one with a bullet; A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it.  Is this more than you bargained for yet? Oh don t mind me, I m watching you two from the closet; Wishing to be the friction in your jeans. Isn t it messed up how I m just dying to be him? I m just a notch in your bedpost, But you re just a line in a song. Notch in your bedpost, but you re just a line in a song.   Drop a heart, break a name. We re always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team.  We re going down, down in an earlier round. And Sugar, we re going down swinging. I ll be your number one with a bullet; A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it.  We re going down, down in an earlier round. And Sugar, we re going down swinging. I ll be your number one with a bullet; A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it.  Down, down in an earlier round. And Sugar, we re going down swinging. I ll be your number one with a bullet; A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it.  We re going down, down in an earlier round. Take aim at myself.  And Sugar, we re going down swinging. Take back what you said.  I ll be your number one with a bullet; Take aim at myself.  A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it.  We re going down, down. Down, down.  Down, down. Down, down.  We re going down, down. Down, down.  A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it.  We re going down, down in an earlier round. Take aim at myself.  And Sugar, we re going down swinging. Take back what you said.  I ll be your number one with a bullet; Take aim at myself.  A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it.  </BODY>
