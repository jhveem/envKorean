<BODY>I ve made up my mind, Don t need to think it over If I m wrong, I am right Don t need to look no further, This ain t lust I know this is love But, if I tell the world I ll never say enough Cos it was not said to you And that s exactly what I need to do If I end up with you  [Chorus] Should I give up, Or should I just keep chasin pavements? Even if it leads nowhere Or would it be a waste Even if I knew my place Should I leave it there Should I give up, Or should I just keep chasin pavements Even if it leads nowhere  I build myself up And fly around in circles Waitin as my heart drops And my back begins to tingle Finally, could this be it  [Chorus] Or should I give up Or should I just keep chasin pavements Even if it leads nowhere Or would it be a waste Even if I knew my place Should I leave it there  Should I give up Or should I just keep chasin pavements Even if it leads nowhere Or would it be a waste Even if I knew my place should I leave it there Should I give up Or should I just keep on chasin pavements Should I just keep on chasin pavements Ohh oh  [Chorus]  [출처] Grammy Nominees 2009 Adele/Chasing Pavements|작성자 디폴</BODY>
