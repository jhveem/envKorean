Delicious, Ely, Bazz and Eonand the aroma of the blunts has me thinking beyondAnd to the rest of the crew you know the bond is strongand you know who s who, so let me not prolongFor this was a night to rememberI had on the beige Tims with the two tone leatherSo we get to the jam, the gig, the venuethen we circled around and then drove in throughthe front the place was packed the line was longI was bobbing my head cuz the music was onI turned it down then I peeped to my rightI saw this kid and his girl having a fightAnother kid walked up and mushed the kid in his faceand then the kid pulled out and bust and laid him to waistA riot broke out girls screaming and scheming crewsstarted buck wiling tryna snatch kids jewelsAfter that 50 came and turned the party outand then the ambulance came to take the body outAnd we didn t even get all the equipment outand we didn t even get to turn the place outThis can happen often and it s really fucked upSo I ll ask you to your face homeboy what s upDid you come to see my show or the stupid nigger playoffsKilling you and killing me it s the soliloquy of chaosAnd if you live in the cities where streets reek warfarepeople getting nowhere bot you go for yours thereYou ll find it doesn t pay to front or play the roleYou could get stole or maybe beat with a poleThen you ll wanna retaliate, regroup and come backso you set the brothers up for a sneak attackWhether you die or kill them, it s another brother deadbut I know you ll never get that through your headCuz we re mislead and misfed facts, we re way offkilling you and killing me, it s the soliloquy of chaos다양한 해외힙합곡을 감상하고 싶다면, 공개앨범 &gt; 검색란에 ohojanggoon </BODY>
