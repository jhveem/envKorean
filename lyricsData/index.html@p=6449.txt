<BODY> Tell me how I m supposed to breathe with no air  If I should die before I wake It s cause you took my breath away Losing you is like living in a world with no air Oh  I m here alone, didn t wanna leave My heart won t move, it s incomplete Wish there was a way that I can make you understand  But how do you expect me to live alone with just me Cause my world revolves around you It s so hard for me to breathe  Chorus Tell me how I m supposed to breathe with no air Can t live, can t breathe with no air It s how I feel whenever you ain t there It s no air, no air Got me out here in the water so deep Tell me how you gonna be without me If you ain t here, I just can t breathe It s no air, no air  No air, air No air, air No air, air No air, air  I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew Right off the ground to float to you There s no gravity to hold me down for real  But somehow I m still alive inside You took my breath, but I survived I don t know how, but I don t even care  So how do you expect me to live alone with just me Cause my world revolves around you It s so hard for me to breathe  Chorus No air, air No air, air No air, air No air, air No more It s no air, no air  Chorus x2  No air, air No air, air No air, air No air, air  [출처] Jordin Sparks No Air feat.
