<BODY>Artist: Nas f/ 2pac, J. PhoenixAlbum: God s SonSong: Thugz Mansion[Intro: Nas]I want you to close your eyesAnd vision the most beautiful place in the worldIf you in the hood on the ghetto street cornerCome on this journeyThe best journeyAcres of land and swimming pools and all thatCheck it out[Verson One: Nas]I m capable of anything, my imagination can give me wingsTo fly like does over the streets watchin many thingsKids walkin home from school on drug block missionariesPass out papers that read: Love GodSee faces, cases, judges, juries, masons, lawyers and copsI watch because every thugs face is my mirrorBut this was one in particular This kid he was the vintage stick em up pro16 years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to goEvery mornin calls his comrad to come and get him to smokeHe insane, already gone madBlames himself for his setbacksDangerous street corners where his sets atSlang from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacsChasin him, his ass was flarin Smokin like a chimney, on really, of course he not carin He need a place to go to keep his mind expandin I give him a helpin hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion[Chorus: J. Phoenix]Every corner, every cityThere s a place where life s a little busyLittle Hennessy, laid back and coolEvery hour, cause it s all goodLeave all the stress from the world outsideEvery wrong done will be alright Nothin but peace, love And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion[Verse Two: 2Pac]Dear momma don t cry, your baby boy s doin goodTell the homies I m in heaven and they ain t got hoodsSeen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shookDrippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam CookeThen some lady named Billie HolidaySang sittin there kickin it with Malcolm, til the day cameLittle LaTasha sho grownTell the lady in the liquor store that she s forgiven, so come homeMaybe in time you ll understand only God can save usWhen Miles Davis cuttin lose with the bandJust think of all the people that you knew in the pastthat passed on, they in heaven, found peace at lastPicture a place that they exist, togetherThere has to be a place better than this, in heavenSo right before I sleep, dear God, what I m askinRemember this face, save me a place, in thug s mansion[Chorus][Verse Three: Nas]A place where death doesn t reside, just thugs who collideNot to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin byNo policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streetsNo reason, for nobody s momma to crySee I m a good guy, I m tryin to stick around for my daughterBut if I should die, I know all of my albums support herThis whole year s been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save meOnly difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybeCause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferinI m just twenty some odd years, I done lost my motherAnd I cried tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boyI dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni ShakurCause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a warAnd just for that alone she shouldn t feel no pain no moreCause one day we ll all be together, sippin heavnly champagneWhat angels saw, with golden wings in thug s mansion[Chorus]또 다른 국외힙합곡을 감상하고 싶다면, 공개앨범 &gt; 검색란에 ohojanggoon </BODY>
