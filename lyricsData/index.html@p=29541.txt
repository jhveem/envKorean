<BODY>[Chorus]X2I can t hide my heart from youThe darkness in the closetRevealed to the eyes of the most high,seeing it all from a bird s eye view[Verse 1]Lock the closet, lock and loadedFast forward the motion, the darkest emotionsHidden with security, all the impurityLost in oblivion, confused by obscurityCobras command me to form roadblocksDrifting thoughts threaten to open Pandora s boxThe horror never stops, mental tortureThe more ya try to ignore it, the more it controls yaClose the curtains, searching for closureTrying to find peace when you re losing composureStability, stabilize, stay stableMost these records labels lieAnd the heart is like a ticker keeping timeAs the picture unfolds right before your eyesLetting you know you re still aliveFrom the dirt to the clouds, from the ground to the sky, and I[Chorus]X2I can t hide my heart from youThe darkness in the closetRevealed to the eyes of the most high,seeing it all from a bird s eye view[Verse 2]Pushing daisies from the top soilCarry enough heat to make the pot boilShake hands with land owners who got oilOutside America where the kids are not spoiledRotten, is it a blessing or a curse?Maybe a mixture of both, when worse comes to worstMy God comes first, the living water quenching the deepest thirst healing the hurtBut it seems like the truth hurts, so do the liesThe pain hurts, got your brain working overtimeTrying to change course and it s the same forceThat swings a sledge hammer beating a dead horseA deadbeat dad beating his kidsThey can grow stronger if they learn to live through itBut the father will always hold regretsThe sunshine is watching even when it s dark out, I[Chorus]X2[Verse 3]You can run but you can t hide foreverFrom these eyes, that love life so muchFrom the eyes that see all of humanityFrom the start to the end of your whole family treeWe never realize how much we harm othersTill our heart is uncovered and the truth is discoveredAll over the world, these people are my brothersBut we ignore their needs cause we re selfish and stubbornIf you got 10 dollars or 10 minutesYou can step away from your business and make a differenceYou can step out of the closet and into the streetsYou can get rid of your secrets and celebrate the victoryTeach the young, keep them from the same strugglesHave mercy on the man who s going through some troublesBreak out of your social bubble and open your resourcesfor the benefit of another men s soul![Chorus]X2 I can t hide my heart from youThe darkness in the closetRevealed to the eyes of the most high,seeing it all from a bird s eye view 별명 : 효도쟁이효돌 </BODY>
