<BODY>Take the time just to listen When the voices screaming are much too loud Take a look at the distance Try and see it all  Chances are that ya might find that we share a common discomfort now I feel I m walking a fine line, tell me only if it s real Still I m on my way on and on it goes Vacant hope to take  HEY! I can t live in here for another day Darknees has kept the light concealed, Grim as ever Hold on to faith as I dig another grave Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel. Real as ever and it seems I ve been buried alive!  I walked the fields through the fire Taking steps until I found solid ground Followed dreams reaching higher couldn t survive the fall  Much has changed since the last time and I feel a little less certain now You know I jumped at the first sign tell me only if it s real Memories seem to fade on and on it goes Wash my view away  HEY! I can t live in here for another day Darknees has kept the light concealed, Grim as ever Hold on to faith as I dig another grave Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel. Real as ever and I m chained like a slave trapped in the dark slammed all the locks Death calls my name and it seems I ve been buried alive!   Guitar Solo  Take you down now, burn it all out Throw you all around, get you re fuckin HANDS OFF ME! Whats it feel like? Took the wrong route Watch it fall apart, now you re knockin AT THE WRONG GATE!  For you to pay the toll A price for you alone The only deal you ll find I ll gladly take your soul  While it seems sick, sober up quick Psycho lunatic crushing you with HANDS OF FATE! Shame to find out when it s too late But you re all the same trapped inside INFERNO AWAITS!  Evil Thought can hide I ll help release the mind I ll peel away the skin Release the dark within!   Guitar bleak  This is now your life strike you from the light This is now your life die buried alive This is now your life What it feels like? strike you from the light Yeeah! This is now your life What it feels like? die buried alive I ll be taking your soul This is now your life DIE BURIED ALIVE!  출처 엠넷미디어</BODY>
