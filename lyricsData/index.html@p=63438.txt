<BODY>When I woke up with a massive hang over I didn t even know where I was oh I was stoned there all alone  I couldn t find myself in anywhere But time has stopped, all my senses has gone numb When I was seeking something new  Wind blow in to me Carrying a scent I listen to Drags me out, makes becoming one Now let the time goes by And I shout to nowhere  Take me far from home Can you take me far from home Just let me walk away, to the place where I won t sway Can you take me far from home  Many people says Should be hesitate  But I might know where that end for all They doesn t want to stop at all  Wind blow in to me Carrying a scent I listen to Drags me out, makes becoming one Now let the time goes by And I shout to nowhere  Take me far from home Can you take me far from home Just let me walk away, to the place where I won t sway Can you take me far from home  ㈕직도 남o†nㅓ＼、、＼、。 </BODY>
