<BODY> 작사 : Unknown 작곡 : Unknown 편곡 : Unknown  50 Cent] New York City, you are know ridin with, with 50 Cent, you gotta love it I just wanna chill and twist a lot Catch sunshine in my 745 You drive me crazy, shorty I Need to see you and feel you next to me I ll provide everything you need and I Like your smile, I don t wanna see you cry Got some questions that I gotta ask and I Hope you can come up with the answers babe  [Nate Dogg] Girl, it s either you love me now Would you love me if I was down and out Would you still, have love for me?  Girl, it s either you love me now Would you love me if I was down and out? Would you still, have love for me?  [50 Cent] If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me? If I didn t smell so good, would you still hug me? If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally? If I went back to a Hoop D from a Benz Would you poof and disappear, like some of my friends? If I was hit and I was hurt would you be my side? If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride? I get out and peel a nigga cap and chill in drive I m asking questions to find out how you feel inside If I ain t rap cause I was flip burgers in Burger King Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you re feeling me? In the bed, if I use my tongue would you like that? If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back? Now we can have a little drink, you know a Nightcap And we can go do what you like, I know you like that  [Nate Dogg] Girl, it s either you love me now Would you love me if I was down and out? Would you still, have love for me?  Girl, it s either you love me now Would you love me if I was down and out? Would you still, have love for me?  [50 Cent] Now would you leave me if you father, found out I was thugging? Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I m loving Are you mad cause I m asking you 21 questions? Are you my soulmate? Cause if so, girl you re a blessing Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams? I m staring at you tryna figure how you got in them jeans If I was down would you say things to make me smile? I treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see And when you asked me about it I said It wasn t me  Would you believe me? Or up and leave me? How deep is our bond? If that s all it takes for you to be gone We only humans girl we make mistakes To make it up I do whatever it take I love you like a fat kid love cake You know my style I ll say anything to make you smile  [Nate Dogg] Girl, it s either you love me now Would you love me if I was down and out? Would you still, have love for me?  Girl, it s either you love me now Would you love me if I was down and out? Would you still, have love for me?  [Nate Dogg] Could you love me in a Bentley? Could you love me on a bus? I ll ask 21 questions and they all about us  Could you love me in a Bentley? Could you love me on a bus? I ll ask 21 questions and they all about us   </BODY>
