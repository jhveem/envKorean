<BODY>M A P T H E Soul, M A Z E, lose control.M A Z E, my life is amazin Three blind mice as we re lost in the maze route,lookin for the easiest possible way out.Day in and day out, you run into a closed road.Turning into old folk, chasing after rose gold.What they don t know is that it belongs to a fool.Choosing wants over needs, singing songs of a mule.Carrying their burdens when you barely know the person,and that is the difference between a pharaoh and a servant.I choose to serve no man but serve mankind,at the same time avoiding all of Earth s landmines.You step in it and you blow up,you exit or you grow up, or get locked up.The pigs catch ya eating donuts.But I d rather rhyme bars than sit behind bars.How can a prison cell contain this shining bright star.They have no idea what I could do in a minute s time.Break down the walls of the mazeand run through the finish line.Life is like a maze Life is like a mazeLife is like a mazewhen I m flippin through the pagesLife is like a maze Life is like a mazelife, I m just amazedwhen I m flippin through the pages.Life is like a maze Life is like a mazelife is just amazin when I m flippin through the pages.Life is like a maze Life is like a mazelife is just amazin when I m flippin through the pagesIt s high definition black and white.Is it digital, analog, wack or tight?It s stressful wishing sacrifice, and the list goes on.It s the facts of life.East coast ettiquite, west coast slang.Peace we ll never get if shit don t change.Do you play with the majors or go independent?Gotta stay paid but I m broke like a peasant.Love, sex, greed, addictions.What s next? Need directions.There s nobody left to follow.Wallow in my sorrow for a hollow tomorrow.Life is like a maze, try to keep track of the daysthat take us from place to place.Awaken and face to face.Too many choices, possibilities,indecision is killing me.And if you lend a helping hand,then I will follow willingly.Life is like a maze Life is like a mazeLife is like a mazewhen I m flippin through the pagesLife is like a maze Life is like a mazelife, I m just amazedwhen I m flippin through the pages.Life is like a maze Life is like a mazelife is just amazin when I m flippin through the pages.Life is like a maze Life is like a mazelife is just amazin when I m flippin through the pagesM A P T H E Soul, M A Z E, lose control.M A P T H E SoulFlip through fashion magazines,cop a swag or lean.When nothing s goin smooth ,rub a little vaseline.Do an online, offline, frontline search.Either quench or confine your Columbine thirst.Cuz you wanna fit in...and find a perfect match to set your heart in flames.You wanna be a catch.Catch 22, catch the flu, catchphrase.By any means necessary in this rat s maze.It s a black haze muddle, a rainy day puddle...life is gonna wet ya, get ya in a muzzle.A struggle to survive,a huddle nine to five with no quarterback.Change? You won t even get a quarter back.It s a murder fact, reality kills.Call your doctor now for your reality pills.Chill, but still worry... a bug s goin around.Cuz life is like your homie, it s holdin you down .Life is like a maze Life is like a mazeLife is like a mazewhen I m flippin through the pagesLife is like a maze Life is like a mazelife, I m just amazedwhen I m flippin through the pages.Life is like a maze Life is like a mazelife is just amazin when I m flippin through the pages.Life is like a maze Life is like a mazelife is just amazin when I m flippin through the pagesM A Z E, my life is amazin  Maze Feat.
