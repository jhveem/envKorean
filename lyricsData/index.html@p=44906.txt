<BODY>Time, is going by, so much faster than I, And I m starting to regret not spending all of it with you. Now I m, wondering why, I ve kept this bottled inside, So I m starting to regret not selling all of it to you. So if I haven t yet, I ve gotta let you know...  Your never gonna be alone! From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go, I won t let you fall... Your never gonna be alone! I ll hold you til the hurt is gone.  And now, as long as I can, I m holding on with both hands, Cuz forever I believe that there s nothing I could need but you, So if I haven t yet, I ve gotta let you know...  Your never gonna be alone! From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go, I won t let you fall. When all hope is gone, I know that you can carry on. We re gonna see the world out, I ll hold you til the hurt is gone.  Ooooh! You ve gotta live every single day, Like it s the only one, what if tomorrow never comes? Don t let it slip away, Could be our only one, you know it s only just begun. Every single day, May be our only one, what if tomorrow never comes? Tomorrow never comes...  Time, is going by, so much faster than I, And I m starting to regret not telling all of this to you.  Your never gonna be alone! From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go, I won t let you fall. When all hope is gone, I know that you can carry on. We re gonna see the world out, I ll hold you til the hurt is gone.  I m gonna be there always, I won t be missing one more day, I m gonna be there always, I won t be missing one more day.
