<BODY>Artist: Lauryn HillAlbum: MTV UnpluggedSong: Adam Lives in TheoryAdam lives in theoryTrying to turn stone into breadMasquerading like he got it figured out Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own headLeaving his descendants to hope and doubtLeft to his devices, those worth the sacrificesPraying to the alter of himselfMaking pilgrimages, thinking he s religiousLike he s got all the light, and no one elseHe takes the unsuspectedCuz he knows they re not connectedAnd he shows them how to be just as he isVirtually real, and commercially appealedTo the lust of all the people where he livesEve was so naive, blinded by the pride and greedWanting to be intellectualDrifting from the way she got turned down one dayAnd now she thinks that she s bisexualCaught up in emotionBurning up in her devotionTo the king of exploitaion in the fieldShe handed him her virtueCuz he told her I won t hurt you So she lay with him to see how good it feelsNow can you tell me, what, what we gonna do nowWhere we gonna go now, what we gonna say nowNow can you tell me, what, what we gonna do nowWhere we gonna go now, what we gonna say nowNow after the sensation, and the empty fornicationShe brought affection home into her bed, quickly multiplyingNow the 3 of them are dieing by the poison she perceived to be good headNow Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgmentCuz everything appears to be the sameThey entertain suggestion,Next time just use protectionDesiring to cover up their shameBut much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyesTo the very antidote to their dilemmaBurning in their lust,Both of them were dealt to usDestroying the original agendaPraying to the sky, in order to maintain a lieThey exhausted every possible conclusion,They can t even entertain the solution,In a brain filled with vain information and pollutionHiding from the truth,He provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situationWhen confronted, blamed his wifeGiving birth to carnal lifeRefusing to acknowledge what he doneNow if we can agree with who created us to beWho says we re guilty everyone before his eyesMaking no exceptions, since the day of our conceptionPredisposed to hating truth, and loving liesThen can you tell me, what, what we gonna do nowWhere we gonna go now, what we gonna say nowThen can you tell me, what, what we gonna do nowWhere we gonna go now, what we gonna say nowStop walking in pride, let the thief be crucifiedUn learn everything you know, and let him teach youLine upon line, every step upon pre step, say goodbye,To this decaying social systemHe wants to know, how far we re willing to goIf we love him like we say we do,He will try usJust don t regress,Or slip into hopelessnessOnce he s satisfied his love,He won t deny us,And then he ll tell us,What, what we gonna do nowWhere we gonna go now, what we gonna say nowAnd then he ll tell us,What, what we gonna do nowWhere we gonna go now, what we gonna say now다양한 해외힙합곡을 감상하고 싶다면, 공개앨범 &gt; 검색란에, ohojanggoon </BODY>
