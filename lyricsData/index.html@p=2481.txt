<BODY>  I m sick of seeing your face everywhere I go I m sick of receiving gifts when it s all for show I think I ve warned you about a thousand times You just don t get it, ooh boy You ve crossed the line  Try to impress me in front of all your friends You re so pathetic Just put it to an end There s a limit to how much a girl can take And you ve gone past it But I guess that s your mistake  Now please don t think I m just playing hard to get You re really pushing me to my limit What does it take to get this message to your head? You leave me no choice Ima have to break it down like this   가버려 yeah 제발 이젠 그만해 더 이상 붙잡진 마 가버려 yeah 날 자유롭게 날려줘 Just set me free, yeah   I told you to stop, you put me to the test It s called love, and no, you won t get none of it Boy, you re tiring me down, trying so hard to please me But it s not working Suggest you get up and leave  & Repeat  I said stop! Quit pestering me I said stop! Just set me free I said stop! I thought I told you to leave I said stop! Just let me be Why can t you stop?!  & Repeat  Repeat  Chorus Sunny, Bonnie Recorded by 김기완 at Paramount Studio in LA, CA Mixed by Michael Schlesinger at Ameraycan Studio in LA, CA Assistant 김기완, Jay Gonzales, Pete Novak     </BODY>
