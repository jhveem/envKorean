But if you would only take the time, I know in my heart you d find, Oh, a girl who s scared sometimes, who isn t always strong. Can t you see the hurt in me? I feel so all alone.  후렴 I wanna run to you, I wanna run to you. Won t you hold me in your arms And keep me safe from harm? I wanna run to you. But if I come to you, Tell me will you stay, Or will you run away?  Each day, each day I play the role of someone always in control. But at night, I come home and turn the key. There s nobody there, no one cares for me. Oh what s the sense of trying hard to find your dreams without someone to share them with Tell me, what does it mean?  후렴 반복  Run away, No, I need you here, I need you here to wipe away my tears, to kiss away my fears. No, if you only know how much  </BODY>
