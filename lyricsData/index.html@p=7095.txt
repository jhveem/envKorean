<BODY> You Raise Me Up 원곡은Josh Groban이불렀습니다 세상의 모든 천사When I am down and, oh my soul, so wearyWhen troubles come and my heart burdened beThen, I am still and wait here in the silence,Until you come and sit awhile with meYou raise me up, so I can stand on mountainsYou raise me up, to walk on stormy seasI am strong, when I am on your shouldersYou raise me up To more than I can beMusical Interlude 간주You raise me up, so I can stand on mountainsYou raise me up, to walk on stormy seasI am strong, when I am on your shouldersYou raise me up To more than I can beThere is no life &nbsp;no life without &nbsp;its hungerEach restless heart beats so imperfectlyBut when you come and I am filled &nbsp;with wonderSometimes, I think I glimpse eternityYou raise me up, so I can stand on mountainsYou raise me up, to walk &nbsp;on stormy seasI am strong, when I am &nbsp;on your shouldersYou raise me up &nbsp;To more than I can beYou raise me up, To more than I can be You Riase Me UpBecky Taylor </BODY>
