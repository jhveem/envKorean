<BODY> He was my best frined I tried to help him But he traded everything for suffering And found himself alone I watched the lying turn into hiding With scars on both his lips His fingertips were melted to the bone  But I can still remember What his face looked like When I found him in an alley In the middle of the night  Tell me what you know Tell me what you´ve gone and done now Tell me what you know Tell me what you´ve gond and done now A gun would do the trick To get it over with You´re better off To take all that you got N´ burn it on the spot Just to get high high high  3 days no sleeping He gave up eating He sold his mother´s rings She said nothing And prretended not to know He started stealing To supply the feeling Found out he pulled a knife On someone´s wife And held it to her throat  But I can still remember What his face looked like When I found him in an alley In the middle of the night  Tell me what you do Where you got it hid Show me Is what you really want Watching what you´ve got Slowly Circling the drain Thow it all away Just to get high high high [출처] Nickelback Just To Get High|작성자 딩고  </BODY>
