<BODY>It′′s like whatever I say  Ooh, Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh  [Verse 1:]  Now, now she loved me, shawty I loved her.  Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out.  Used to care, she used to share...  The love that she used to give me can′′t be found.  I lost my way, she said she′′d stay.  And lately I′′ve been sleeping with a ghost!  My stock is down and out,  I used to be worth my weight in gold.  That was before the great  depression kicked in and rocked us.  And that was before the hurricane,  came in and stopped us.  I told you to leave,  but you lied to me...  When you said that, baby no worries  I promise to get us back.  [Chorus:]  I′′m so sorries, just wouldn′′t do it.  Her heart is obliterated, I′′m trying,  I′′m trying my boo,  But it′′s like moving mountains...  It′′s like moving mountains... hey.  But I keep climbing  and hoping things would change...  And the sky turns grey, and the water from  the rain washes progress away.  It′′s like moving mountains...  It′′s like moving mountains...  [Hook:]  Why you just leave me?  Just leave me be...  Just leave me, just leave me be...  Why you just leave me?  Just leave me be...  Why you just leave me?  Just leave me be... oh!  [Verse 2:]  She, she don′′t touch me,  I don′′t touch her.  We really even never say a word.  I really want to give her everything she deserves.  But the bag took away the curve...  She thinks that I′′m full of it... arguments,  always pissed, man I′′m tired...  Every kiss, bed I missed, girl you know I′′m trying!  You never believe when I say,  and I never believe it when you say...  I love you, and I shouldn′′t complain about it,  I should take it like a man and walk up out it.  Cause we will never be the same oh!  I′′ve been standing in gas,  and you would be the flame!  [Chorus:]  I′′m so sorries, just wouldn′′t do it!  Her heart is obliterated, I′′m trying to get through...  Got to move this mountain... yeah.  It′′s like moving mountains... hey.  But I keep climbing and hoping things would change...  And the sky turns grey, and the water  from the rain washes progress away.  It′′s like moving mountains...  It′′s like moving mountains...  [Hook:]  Well baby why you just leave me?  Just leave me be, just leave me...  Just leave me be...  Why you just leave me?  Just leave me be...  Why you just leave me?  Just leave me be... oh!  [Background Singing]  [Chorus:]  I′′m so sorries, just wouldn′′t do it  Her heart is obliterated, I′′m trying, I′′m trying my boo,  But it′′s like moving mountains...  It′′s like moving mountains... hey.  But I keep climbing and hoping things would change...  And the sky turns grey, and the water  from the rain washes progress away.  It′′s like moving mountains...  It′′s like moving mountains...  [Hook:]  Well baby why you just leave me?  Just leave me be, just leave me, just leave me be...  Why you just leave me? Just leave me be...  Why you just leave me? Just leave me be... oh!  DY 사랑한다 </BODY>
