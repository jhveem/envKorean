<BODY>She’s just a girl, and she’s on fireHotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highwayShe’s living in a world, and it’s on fireFeeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly awayOh, she got both feet on the groundAnd she’s burning it downOh, she got her head in the cloudsAnd she’s not backing downThis girl is on fireThis girl is on fireShe’s walking on fireThis girl is on fireLooks like a girl, but she’s a flameSo bright, she can burn your eyesBetter look the other wayYou can try but you’ll never forget her nameShe’s on top of the worldHottest of the hottest girls sayOh, we got our feet on the groundAnd we’re burning it downOh, got our head in the cloudsAnd we’re not coming downThis girl is on fireThis girl is on fireShe’s walking on fireThis girl is on fireEverybody stands, as she goes byCause they can see the flame that’s in her eyesWatch her when she’s lighting up the nightNobody knows that she’s a lonely girlAnd it’s a lonely worldBut she gon’ let it burn, baby, burn, babyThis girl is on fireThis girl is on fireShe’s walking on fireThis girl is on fireshe’s just a girl, and she’s on fire Girl On Fire Main Ver.
