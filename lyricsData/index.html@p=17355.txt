<BODY> Paranoia is in bloom, The PR transmissions will resume They ll try to, push drugs that keep us all dumbed down And hope that, we will never see the truth around so come on  Another promise, another seed Another, packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed And all the, Green belts wrapped around our minds And endless, red tape to keep the truth confined so come on   They will not force us They will stop degrading us They will not control us We will be victorious so come on  Interchanging mind control Come let the, revolution takes its toll If you could, flick the switch and open your third eye You d see that We should never be afraid to die so come on   Rise up and take the power back It s time the fat cats had a heart attack They know that their time s coming to an end We have to unify and watch our flag ascend  They will not force us They will stop degrading us They will not enslave us We will be victorious  They will not force us They will stop degrading us They can not control us We will be victorious  [출처] The Resistance 전곡 가사.. 뮤즈 Muse 팬카페 |작성자 Lico </BODY>
