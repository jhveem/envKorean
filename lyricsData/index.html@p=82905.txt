<BODY>Sometimes as women we give more than we should To a man that just don t treat us good, No Gave him my heart my time Did all that I could in the past to keep him here with me, yeah But now I woke up, Opened both my eyes up Realize that I don t need any other. Man, if you can t love me equally, Then you don t need to be with me Nothing more beautiful then knowing you re worth And finally, I know exactly what I deserve  [Chorus:] I m doin me, this time around I m doin me, don t need you now I rather be by myself, I won t let your drama hold me down I m doin me, this time around I m doin me, I ve finally found I d rather be by myself, I m doin me.  [Verse 2:] Won t spend another minute wasting my time On a man, hey, that only tells me lies, no Aint saying that I don t need love But them games, I don t need that in my life, no  [Chorus]  I m doin me, this time around I m doin me, don t need you now I rather be by myself, I won t let your drama hold me down I m doin me, this time around I m doin me, I ve finally found I d rather be by myself, I m doin me.  I could pray for you to act right everyday But it ain t up to me to make you change Life is too damn short to live unhappily So I m being selfish and putting myself in first place  [Chorus:] I m doin me, this time around I m doin me, don t need you now I rather be by myself, I won t let your drama hold me down I m doin me, this time around I m doin me, I ve finally found I d rather be by myself, I m doin me.  I m doing me This time around I m doing me This time around No more crying, going thru hell It s so good, I m lovin myself I m doin me This time around I m doin me I m doin me Yeah Yeah I m doin me Yeah Yeah [출처] Fantasia I m Doin Me|작성자 만능로봇</BODY>
