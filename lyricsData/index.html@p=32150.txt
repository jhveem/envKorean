<BODY>Sunday morning rain is falling Steal some covers share some skin Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable You twist to fit the mold that I am in But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew That someday it would lead me back to you That someday it would lead me back to you  That may be all I need In darkness she is all I see Come and rest your bones with me Driving slow on Sunday morning And I never want to leave  Fingers trace your every outline Paint a picture with my hands Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm Change the weather still together when it ends  That may be all I need In darkness she is all I see Come and rest your bones with me Driving slow on Sunday morning And I never want to leave  But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do Sunday morning rain is falling and Im calling out to you Singing someday itll bring me back to you Find a way to bring myself back home to you  And you may not know That may be all I need In darkness she is all I see Come and rest your bones with me Driving slow on Sunday morning  ㈕직도 남o†nㅓ＼、、＼、。</BODY>
