<BODY> I dont wanna be left behind Distance was a friend of mine Catching breath in a web of lies Ive spent most of my life Riding waves, playing acrobat Shadowboxing the other half Learning how to react Ive spent most of my time  Catching my breath, letting it go, Turning my cheek for the sake of the show Now that you know, this is my life, I wont be told whats supposed to be right  Catch my breath, no one can hold me back, I aint got time for that Catch my breath, wont let them get me down, its all so simple now  Addicted to the love I found Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud Making time for the ones that count Ill spend the rest of my time Laughing hard with the windows down Leaving footprints all over town Keeping faith kinda comes around I wont spend the rest of my life  Catching my breath, letting it go, Turning my cheek for the sake of the show Now that you know, this is my life, I wont be told whats supposed to be right  Catch my breath, no one can hold me back, I aint got time for that Catch my breath, wont let them get me down, its all so simple now  You helped me see The beauty in everything  Catching my breath, letting it go, Turning my cheek for the sake of the show Now that you know, this is my life, I wont be told whats supposed to be right  Catching my breath, letting it go, Turning my cheek for the sake of the show Now that you know, this is my life, I wont be told whats supposed to be right  Catch my breath!  Catch my breath, no one can hold me back, I aint got time for that Catch my breath, wont let them get me down, its all so simple now Its all so simple now!  Catching my breath, letting it go, Turning my cheek for the sake of the show Now that you know, this is my life, I wont be told whats supposed to be right  Catch my breath  Catch my breath, no one can hold me back, I aint got time for that Catch my breath  Catch my breath, wont let them get me down, its all so simple now 가사입력NAKMUSE  </BODY>
