<BODY>[MYK] I remember my first glimpse of her face. I saw you smile, then I smiled, I was straight blownaway.Mesmerized by your beauty from your feet to yourhands.How can one be so beautiful? I don t understand.Heaven sent, God s gift without a doubt in mymind.Sometimes I wonder why our paths decided to colide.We started off as perfect strangers. Boy meets girl.Infatuation to love. Now you re my whole entireWorld.Destiny taps me on the back saying. Hello. But really it was your touch, knowing I never letyou go.Then you spoke, I never heard a voice so sweet.Heavenly, and from her words I knew this girl wasdeep.Just lke me. With times to worry and times to play,we ll sit and stress over life or just burn the dayaway.I know for sure in our past lives we had to befriends.Living and dying together knowing that we wouldmeet again.It s just a blessing to have you in my life.I wast destined to be with you.I m privileged, so amazing, no question.And I m knowing, soon enough we ll get wherewe re going.Just thinking about it, I can feel my heart growing.Am I trippin ? Or is it that I finally see?I don t know but my heart is saying you re the onefor me.Please believe me. I m exactly where I want to be.This rhymes is written from my heart to you,sincerely.No reason to live without you.No reason to live without you.No reason to live without you.No reason to live without you.[Tablo]You turn a cocooned soul into a butterfly and I losecontrol.Can never turn aside.You shine like summer skies.Like when a lover lies next to me and says to me, You make me wonder why. You are a beautiful mystery.Every note carved into musical history.A simile, metaphor.words not enough to entrust to you.Trust that It s true.We must have a clue but we ask for evidence.Dwell in passing semtiments though we bask ineminence every moment, every day.Busy getting paid away.The soul fades away into a grainy shade of gray.I pray that you listen to what I say cause I fell likea missing shoe.This is to everything that you are.The wild earth, a child s birth sun, moon and thestars.No reason to live without you.No reason to live without you.No reason to live without you.No reason to live without you.[Kero One]So I ask, what would I be without you?Like Stevie without Wonder, hunger without food.A sheep without a shepherd, asleep without yourmessage.Despite the skeptics, in the end you were true.And I knew there was more to life.And I grew, living for the light.I took my answers, combined them with yours.It made life exciting but it closed some doors.Word to Christ. My life accelerated then deflated.Sunk to bottom, then elevated until I made it.But you always had my back though.When kids threw rocks at me or on stage rappin .Still, I see kids without love.It brings tears to my soul, but why they alwaysdrop up?The world s gone bonkers. You ve conquered fear.And as loang as I believe. You re the reason I mhere.No reason to live without you.No reason to live without you.No reason to live without you.No reason to live without you.L O V E you. I was made to be with you.made to be with you. made to be with you.L O V E you. I was made to be with you.made to be with you. made to be with you.L O V E you. I was made to be with you.made to be with you. made to be with you.L O V E you. I was made to be with you.made to be with you. made to be with you.L O V E you. I was made to be with you.made to be with you. made to be with you. Map The Soul Worldwide Ver. Tablo, MYK & Kero One 타블로</BODY>
