<BODY> Whistle Down The Wind  Whistle down the wind Let your voices carry Drown out all the rain Light a patch of darkness Treacherous and scary  Howl at the stars Whisper when you re sleepy I ll be there you hold you I ll be there to stop The chills and all the weeping  Make it clear and strong So the whole night long Every signal that you send Until the very end I will not abandon you my precious friend  So try and stand the tide Then you ll raise a banner Send a flare up in the sky Try to burn a torch And try to build a bonfire  Every signal that you send Until the very end I m there  So whistle down the wind For I have always been Right there Oh yeah  다음 Daum 의 티나 아레나 카페로 와 보세요!!  http://cafe.daum.net/tinaarena</BODY>
