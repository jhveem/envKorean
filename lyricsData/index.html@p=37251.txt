<BODY>I m at a payphone trying to call home All of my change I ve spent on you Where are the times gone baby It s all wrong, where are the plans we made for two  Yeah, I, I know it s hard to remember The people we used to be It s even harder to picture That you re not here next to me You said it s too late to make it But is it too late to try? And then that time that you wasted All of our bridges burnt down  I ve wasted my nights You turned out the lights Now I m paralyzed Still stucked in that time when we called it love But even the sun sets in paradise  I m at a payphone trying to call home All of my change I ve spent on you Where are the times gone baby It s all wrong, we re at the place we made for two  If happy ever after did exist I would still be holding you like this And all those fairytales are full of shit One more fucking love song I ll be sick  You turned your back on tomorrow Cause you forgot yesterday I gave you my love to borrow But just gave it away You can t expect me to be a fine I don t expect you to care I know I said it before But all of our bridges burnt down  I ve wasted my nights You turned out the lights Now I m paralyzed Still stucked in that time when we called it love But even the sun sets in paradise  I m at a payphone trying to call home All of my change I ve spent on you Where are the times gone baby It s all wrong, where are the plans we made for two  If happy ever after did exist I would still be holding you like this And all those fairytales are full of shit One more fucking love song I ll be sick  Now I m at a payphone  Man fuck that shit I ll be right here spending all this money while you sitting round Wondering why wasn t you who came out from nothing Made it from the botton Now when you see me I m struting And all of my cause a way to push up a button Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it Switched the number to my phone So you never can call it Don t need my name, or my show You can tell it I m ballin  Shish, what a shame coulda got picked Had a really good game but you missed your last shot So you talk about who you see at the top Or what you could ve saw But sad to say it s over for it Phantom roll out valet open doors Where s the car way, got what you was looking for Now ask me who they want So you can go take that little piece of shit with you  I m at a payphone trying to call home All of my change I ve spent on you Where are the times gone baby It s all wrong, we re at the place we made for two  If happy ever after did exist I would still be holding you like this And all these fairytales are full of shit One more fucking love song I ll be sick  Now I m at a payphone  ㈕직도 남o†nㅓ＼、、＼、。 </BODY>
