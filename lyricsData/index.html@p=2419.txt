<BODY> I see the crystal raindrops fallAnd the beauty of it allwhen the sun comes shining throughTo make those rainbows in my mindWhen I think of you some timeAnd I want to spend some time with you Just the two of usWe can make it if we tryJust the two of usJust the two of usBuilding castles in the skyJust the two of usYou and IWe look for love, no time for tearsWasted water’s all that isAnd it don t make no flowers growGood things might come to those who waitNot to those who wait too lateWe got to go for all we know RepeatI hear the crystal raindrops fallOn the window down the hallAnd it becomes the morning dewDarling, when the morning comesAnd I see the morning sunI want to be the one with youJust the two of usWe can make it if we tryJust the two of usJust the two of usBuilding big castles way on highJust the two of usYou and IJust the two of usWe can make it if we try  Just The Two Of Us어반 자카파 </BODY>
