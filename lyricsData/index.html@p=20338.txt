<BODY>Lately I ve been thinkin , thinkin bout what we had I know it was hard, it was all that we knew, yeah. Have you been drinkin , to take all the pain away? I wish that I could give you what you, deserve Cause nothing could ever, ever replace you Nothing can make me feel like you do. You know there s no one, I can relate to And know we won t find a love that s so true.  There s nothing like us, there s nothing like you and me Together through the storm. There s nothing like us, there s nothing like you and me Together.  I gave you everything, baby, everything I had to give Girl, why would you push me away? Lost in confusion, like an illusion You know I m used to making your day. But that is the past now, we didn t last now Guess that this is meant to be. Tell me was it worth it? We were so perfect But baby I just want you to see  There s nothing like us, there s nothing like you and me Together through the storm. There s nothing like us, there s nothing like you and me Together. There s nothing like us, there s nothing like you and me Together through the storm. There s nothing like us, there s nothing like you and me Together 짱똥아 </BODY>
