<BODY>Lucky feat. Colbie Caillat Jason Mraz ♡Loveholic..음악과 함께하는 멋진인생.. Do you hear me, I m talking to you Across the water across the deep blue ocean Under the open sky, oh my, baby I m trying Boy I hear you in my dreams I feel your whisper across the sea I keep you with me in my heart You make it easier when life gets hard I m lucky I m in love with my best friend Lucky to have been where I have been Lucky to be coming home again Ooohh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh They don t know how long it takes Waiting for a love like this Every time we say goodbye I wish we had one more kiss I ll wait for you I promise you, I will I m lucky I m in love with my best friend Lucky to have been where I have been Lucky to be coming home again Lucky we re in love every way Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed Lucky to be coming home someday And so I m sailing through the sea To an island where we ll meet You ll hear the music fill the air I ll put a flower in your hair though the breezes through trees Move so pretty you re all I see As the world keeps spinning round You hold me right here right now I m lucky I m in love with my best friend Lucky to have been where I have been Lucky to be coming home again I m lucky we re in love every way Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed Lucky to be coming home someday Ooohh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooooh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♡Loveholic..음악과 함께하는 멋진인생.. </BODY>
