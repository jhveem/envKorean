<BODY>I have often told you storiesAbout the wayI lived the life of a drifterWaiting for the dayWhen I d take your handAnd sing you songsThen maybe you would sayCome lay with me and love meAnd I would surely stayBut I feel I m growing olderAnd the songs that I have sungEcho in the distanceLike the soundOf a windmill goin roundI guess I ll always be...A soldier of fortuneMany times I ve been a travellerI looked for something newIn days of oldWhen nights were coldI wandered without youBut those days I thought my eyesHad seen you standing nearTho blindness is confusingIt shows that you re not hereNow I feel I m growing olderAnd the songs that I have sungEcho in the distanceLike the soundOf a windmill goin roundI guess I ll always be...A soldier of fortuneYes, I can hear the soundOf a windmill goin roundI guess I ll always beA soldier of fortune  Soldier Of Fortune Deep Purple 임재범</BODY>
