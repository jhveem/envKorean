<BODY>I`m just the pieces of the man I used to beToo many bitter tears areraining down on meI`m far away from homeAnd I`ve been facing this alonefor much too longI feel like no oneever told the truth to me about growing upand what a struggle it would beIn my tangled state of mindI`ve been looking back to findwhere I went wrongToo much love will kill youIf you can`t make up your mindTorn between the loverAnd the love you leave behindYou`re headed for disasterCause you never read the signsToo much love will kill you every timeI`m just the shadowof the man I used to beAnd it seems likethere`s no way out of this for meI used to bring you sunshineNow all I ever do is bring you downHow would it beIf you were standing in my shoesCan`t you see thatit`s impossible to chooseNo, there`s no making sense of itEvery way I go I`m bound to loseToo much love will kill youJust as sure as none at allIt`ll drain the power that`s in youMake you plead and scream and crawlAnd the pain will make you crazyYou`re the victim of your crimeToo much love will kill you every time간주Too much love will kill youIt`ll make your life a lieYes, too much love will kill youAnd you won`t understand whyYou`d give your lifeYou`d sell your soulBut here it comes againToo much love will kill you in the endWritten by [subakH]MyBugs:http://my.bugs.co.kr/subakh※틀린가사 있으면 마이홈 방문이나 쪽지주세요.</BODY>
