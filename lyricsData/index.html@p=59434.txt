<BODY>I&acute;ve got a bad disease But from my brain is where I bleed. Insanity it seems Has got me by my soul to squeeze. Well all the love from thee With all the dying trees I scream. The angels in my dreams yeah Have turned to demons of greed that&acute;s mean. Chorus: Where I go I just don&acute;t know I got to got to gotta take it slow. When I find my piece of mind I&acute;m gonna give you some of my good time. Today love smiled on me. It took away my face say please All that you had to free You gotta let it be oh yeah. Chorus Oh, so polite indeed Well I got everything I need. Oh make my days a breeze And take away my self destruction. It&acute;s bitter baby, And it&acute;s very sweet. I&acute;m on a rollercoaster, but I&acute;m on my feet. Take me to the river, Let me on your shore. I&acute;ll be coming back baby, I&acute;ll be coming back for more. Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone Ba di ba da ba zumba crunga cong gone bad I could not forget But I will not endeavor Simple pleasures aren&acute;t as special But I wont regret it never. Chorus Where I go I just don&acute;t know I might end up somewhere in Mexico. When I find my piece of mind I&acute;m gonna keep you for the end of time. soul to squeezeRed Hot Chili Peppers 레드 핫 칠리 페퍼스 </BODY>
