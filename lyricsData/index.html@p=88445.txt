<BODY>Just like a star across my sky,Just like an angel off the page,You have appeared to my life,Feel like I`ll never be the same,Just like a song in my heart,Just like oil on my hands,Oh.. I do love you,Still i wonder why it is,I don`t argue like this,With anyone but you,We do it all the time,Blowing out my mind,You`ve got this look i can`t describe,You make me feel like I`m alive,When everything else is a fade,Without a doubt you`re on my side,Heaven has been away too long,Can`t find the words to write this song,Oh.,.. your love,Still i wonder why it is,I don`t argue like this,With anyone but you,We do it all the time,Blowing out my mind,♬I have come to understand,The way it is,It`s not a secret anymore,`cause we`ve been through that before,From tonight I know that you`re the only one,I`ve been confused and in the dark,Now I understand,♬I wonder why it is,I don`t argue like this,With anyone but you,I wonder why it is,I wont let my guard down,For anyone but youWe do it all the time,Blowing out my mind,Just like a star across my sky,Just like an angel off the page,You have appeared to my life,Feel like I`ll never be the same,Just like a song in my heart,Just like oil on my hands  Like A StarCorinne Bailey Rae 코린 베일리 래 </BODY>
