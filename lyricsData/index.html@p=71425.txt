<BODY>Artist: GangStarr f/ Inspectah DeckAlbum: Full Clip: A Decade of GangStarr Disc One 1999 Song: Above the Clouds It has come to our attention that a mysterious force is LOOSE.. somewhere in outer space.  The mysteries of creation are there.  Up in the sky? Up in the sky.  The moon and the planets are there. And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there. And therefore as we set sail; we ask God s blessing  on the most hazardous, and dangerous, and greatest adventure of which man has ever embarked. &gt; John F. Kennedy Prepared for liftoff.
