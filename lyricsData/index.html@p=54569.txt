<BODY>Woah, ohh Welcome to the greatest show Greatest show on earth You&acute;ve never seen before Here the fairytale unfolds What&acute;s behind the smoke and glass? Painted faces, everybody wears a mask Are you selling them your soul? Well you&acute;ll be left out in the cold Is it all blue skies Fun and games untill you fall Then you&acute;re left without anyone at all You&acute;re riding on a shooting star With a smile upon your face But soon the shine fades And you&acute;re left out all alone Wondering where did they all go? Oooh Been jaded, hated, Who&acute;ll be around when the limelight&acute;s faded? Been shut down, pushed out Made to smile when I wanted to frown Always taking a bow Always working the crowd Always breaking new ground Always playing the clown Who&acute;ll be sticking it out? Who&acute;ll be staying around When the lights go down?  whistles to fade  WelcomeChristina Aguilera 크리스티나 아귈레라 </BODY>
