<BODY>I m singing in the rainJust singing in the rainWhat a glorious feelingI m happy againI m laughing at cloudsSo dark up abovethe sun s in my heartAnd I m ready for loveLet the stormy clouds chaseEveryone from the placeCome on with the rainI ve a smile on my faceI ll walk down the laneWith a happy refrainJust singing, singing in the rainDancing in the rain..I m happy againI m singing and dancing in the rainDancing and singing in the rain..Let the stormy clouds chaseEveryone from the placeCome on with the rainI ve a smile on my faceI ll walk down the laneWith a happy refrainJust singing, singing in the rainDancing in the rain..I m happy againI m singing and dancing in the rainDancing and singing in the rain..
