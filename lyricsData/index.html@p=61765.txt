<BODY>Is it worth it can you even hear meStanding with your spotlight on meNot enough to feed the hungryI m tired and I felt it for a while nowIn this sea of lonelyThe taste of ink is getting oldIt s four o clock in the fucking morningEach day gets more and more like the last dayStill I can see it comingWhile I m standing in the river drowningThis could be my chance to break outThis could be my chance to say goodbyeAt last it s finally overCouldn t take this town much longerBeing half dead wasn t what I planned to beNow I m ready to be freeSo here I am it s in my handsAnd I ll savor every moment of thisSo here I am alive at lastAnd I ll savor every moment of thisAnd won t you think I m prettyWhen I m standing top the bright lit cityAnd I ll take your hand and pick you upAnd keep you there to so you can seeAs long as you re alive and careI promise I will take you thereAnd we ll drink and dance the night awaydrink and dance the night away 후렴구 반복 As long as you re aliveHere I amI promise I will take you thereas long as you re aliveHere i am 2절 반복 </BODY>
