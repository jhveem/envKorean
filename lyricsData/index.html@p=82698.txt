<BODY>Slow Motion Karina 카리나  I know that you`ve been calling me And I`m happy that we met Don`t think that I`m not interested I`m just playing hard to get So much about this crazy game they call love That I`m trying to understand So would you be my best friend Before you call yourself my man Why can`t I love you in slow motion Take my time Take away the pressure on my mind Really get to know you But rewind Wanna love you in slow motion Why can`t I You seem to know just what you want And I like your confidence Some things a girl should never rush Cause if you do you hurt yourself So much about this crazy game they call love I`m still trying to understand So would you be my best friend Before you call yourself my man Why can`t I love you in slow motion Take my time Take away the pressure on my mind Teally get to know you But rewind Wanna love you in slow motion Why can`t I I`m too young for tears in the night And it`s too soon for this to be right Don`t wanna mess with your pride The question is not when but why Why can`t I love you in slow motion Take my time Take away the pressure on my mind Really get to know you But rewind I wanna love you in slow motion Why can`t I END </BODY>
