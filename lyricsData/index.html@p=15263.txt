<BODY> Do do do do do do do do Ohh Yeah Gotta change my answering machine Now that I m alone Cuz right now it says that we Can’t come to the phone And I know it makes no sense Cuz you walked out the door But its the only way I hear your voice anymore It s ridiculous Its been months And for some reason I just Can’t get over us And I’m stronger then this Enough is enough No more walkin round With my head down I’m so over being blue Cryin over you And I’m so sick of love songs So tired of tears So done with wishing you were still here Said I m so sick of love songs so sad and slow So why can’t I turn off the radio Leave me alone Stupid love songs Don’t make me think about her smile or having my first child Let it go Turning off the radio So done with wishin you were still here And I m so sick of love songs So tired of tears So done with wishin you were still here  Said I m so sick of love songs so sad and slow So why can’t I turn off the radio Why can’t I turn off the radio Gotta change my answering machine Now that I m alone  ㈕직도 남o†nㅓ＼、、＼、。  </BODY>
